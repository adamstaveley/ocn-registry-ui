		This is a client for the
		<a href="https://shareandcharge.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OCN/overview">
			Open Charging Network</a>'s 
		decentralized address book of participants, also known as the
		<a href="https://bitbucket.org/shareandcharge/ocn-registry">OCN Registry</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		There is no backend between you and the Registry. You interact with the
		smart contracts directly.
	</p>

	<p>
		Right now you can only view data for the test and production networks
		(listed below). If you want to manage your data in the Registry,
		try out the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shareandcharge/ocn-registry#cli">
		command line interface</a>.
	</p>

	<!-- <p>However, it is up to you to keep your private key secure. Right now
		the client does not support metamask but this is planned for the 
		future.
	</p> -->

	<p>
		Don't trust this deployment? If you prefer, you can

			check out the source
		</a>
		and follow the instructions to run it yourself.
