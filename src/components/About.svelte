		This is a client for the

			Open Charging Network
		</a>
		's decentralized address book of participants, also known as the
		<a href="https://bitbucket.org/shareandcharge/ocn-registry">OCN Registry</a>
		.
	</p>

	<p>
		There is no backend. You communicate with the OCN Registry smart contracts
		directly.
	</p>

	<p>
		Right now you can only view data. Further updates will add the ability to
		modify state in the smart contracts.
	</p>

	<!-- <p>However, it is up to you to keep your private key secure. Right now
		the client does not support metamask but this is planned for the 
		future.
	</p> -->
